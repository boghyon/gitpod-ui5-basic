**Note:**
SAP Fiori related IDE extensions, such as [`ui5-language-assistant`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SAPOSS.vscode-ui5-language-assistant), are not yet published to Open VSX (See https://github.com/SAP/ui5-language-assistant/issues/344). However, such extensions can be locally downloaded (as `*.vsix`) and uploaded to your Gitpod workspace manually via drag-and-drop.
